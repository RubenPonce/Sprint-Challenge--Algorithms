#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Probably O(n) because n will increase linearly because n is not growing the number of operations and is dependent on what is put into the function


b) Also O(n) because J is reset to 1 in response to how many times it iterates through how many times j is less than n


c) Also O(n) because the number of bunnies is just iterating through the range of bunnies initially put in

## Exercise II
